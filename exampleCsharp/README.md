### `README.md` for `exampleCsharp` App

# exampleCsharp App

The `exampleCsharp` app provides a minimal React Native app that implements Plaid Link, allowing you to link a sample bank account. This example includes support for Windows using C#.

### Prerequisites

Before running the example app, ensure you have:

- A [Plaid Account](https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup) to obtain your API keys.
- A [Link Token](https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#linktokencreate). You can quickly fetch one using your API keys and the [Plaid Postman collection](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-postman).
- A properly set up React Native [development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), including support for Windows, iOS, and Android.

## Running the `exampleCsharp` App

1. **Navigate to the Example Directory:**

   ```sh
   cd exampleCsharp
   ```

2. **Install Node Modules:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install React Native Windows CLI:**

   ```sh
   npm install -g react-native-windows
   ```

4. **Set Up the Windows Project:**

   Navigate to the `windows` folder:

   ```sh
   cd windows
   ```

   If you haven't already set up the necessary dependencies, you might need to install additional tools like Visual Studio with UWP development tools.

5. **Install Bundler and Run the Pod Install (For iOS):**

   ```sh
   bundle install
   bundle exec pod install
   ```

6. **Start the React Native Server:**

   Go back to the root directory of the `exampleCsharp` app and start the Metro bundler:

   ```sh
   cd ..
   npx react-native start
   ```

7. **Run the App on Your Target Platform:**

   - **iOS:**  
     ```sh
     npx react-native run-ios
     ```

   - **Android:**  
     ```sh
     npx react-native run-android
     ```

   - **Windows:**  
     Make sure to open the solution file in Visual Studio and build the project for Windows. Then, run:
     ```sh
     npx react-native run-windows
     ```
     Build release:

     ```sh
     npx react-native run-windows --release
     ```

### Running on Different Simulators

## Testing Plaid Link

1. **Fetch a [Link Token](https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#linktokencreate).**
2. **Paste the Token** into the `TextField` in the `exampleCsharp` app.
3. **Press "OPEN LINK"** to initiate the Plaid Link process.
4. If you're testing in the Plaid Sandbox environment, use the provided [test credentials](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/test-credentials/) for any financial institution:

   - **Username:** `user_good`  
   - **Password:** `pass_good`
